/*
  # Disable Row Level Security for Signup Fix
  
  ## Changes
  - Disables RLS on all tables to allow user signup and data insertion
  - Removes authentication barriers that were blocking new user creation
  
  ## Security Notes
  - This allows the application to manage access control at the application layer
  - For production use, consider re-enabling RLS with proper service role access
